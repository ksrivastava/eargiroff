My name is Emma Argiroff and I currently attend the University of Michigan. I have also taken summer classes through the College of Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan and Studio Arts Center International in Florence, Italy. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree at the University of Michigan’s Penny Stamps School of Art and Design, as well as a degree in Environmental Science at the University of Michigan’s College of Literature, Science and the Arts. I am interested in how humans relate to and influence their environment and would like to combine this interest with my passion for art.
